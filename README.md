In this project, we created an anti-theft bicycle alarm system. We used sw-420 vibration sensor for mesuring analog vibrations which were primarily used to wake the esp32 from sleep if the vibrations were above a certain threshold. An RFID module was used to lock or unlock the cycle. MPU6050 was used as an imu module which was used to detect acceleration in case the cycle was being stolen by carefully picking it and accelerating it in a vehicle, its gyroscope was used to measure the tilt of the bicycle in case it as tampered with. All this information was sent to an app we made using firebase and an alert was sent to the mobile containing the app.
In case the bicycle was still stolen, we used SIM808 as a GSM/GPRS GPS module to track the cycle. These modules use the mobile data which comes from a SIM card put in the module, but SIM808 requires a 2G SIM card which was impossible to attain in today's time. But since we already had the module, we used WiFi from ESP32 as a source for mobile data but used the SIM module to transmit GPS coordinates and other sensor data back to the app. The GPS module we used was the one tat can be directly attached to the SIM module.
